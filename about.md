  <p><strong>Will and Karla Gray-Roncal</strong> started volunteering and mentoring students way back when they were in high school (sometime late in the last millennium), and started a tutoring program to help students when they were in college together at Vanderbilt. Over the years, they continued to volunteer and meet students who needed help achieving their dreams.</p>

  <p>After moving to Maryland in 2006, they began visiting area high school students and conferences and presenting information about attending college, finding financial aid, and pursuing STEM careers, often in conjunction with the Bridges Program of Howard County and Maryland MESA. They were very excited to bring their information to students and their families, but were frustrated that they weren't able to follow up with students after the workshops.</p>

  <p>In 2009, they approached Maryland MESA and APL about the idea of a partnership to support a new program called <strong>College Prep</strong>. This program would be a comprehensive and intense introduction to overcoming barriers, applying to college, succeeding once enrolled, and finding satisfying careers in STEM. The idea was to offer a free program that facilitated close mentoring and guidance through the process in a supportive environment — mimicking the $8000/student private college prep tutoring experience for students who didn't have the resources and opportunities to navigate the path through college on their own.</p>

  <p><strong>MESA and APL said "Yes!"</strong> and the College Prep Program was born. Now in its 6th year, it has reached over 100 students and is poised to continue to grow and support its alumni and current students. CPP partners with the APL STEM office and Maryland MESA to give back and help our community.</p>

  <h2 class="text-primary">Why We Started CPP</h2>

  <p>Students who are underrepresented in STEM fields — including women, African-American, Hispanic, and Native American students — often face significant barriers in entering these careers. Low-income students and those who are the first in their families to go to college also encounter challenges in terms of access to resources, role models, and critical information.</p>

  <p>When we started CPP, we wanted to help change the following statistics:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The U.S. faces a growing shortage of scientists and engineers. [1]</li>
    <li>Less than 30% of U.S. adults have a four-year college degree. [2]</li>
    <li>Only 57% of students who begin a bachelor’s degree finish within 6 years. [3]</li>
    <li>Only ~5% of bachelor’s degrees are in engineering or tech majors. [4]</li>
    <li>60% of engineering, science, and pre-med students switch out or fail to complete their degree. [5]</li>
    <li>In 2006, African American and Hispanic students earned only 8.3% and 7.7% of STEM bachelor’s degrees, and only 2.5% and 2.9% of PhDs. Women earned under 20% of engineering degrees. [6]</li>
    <li>Only 10% of students at the top 150 colleges come from the bottom 50% income bracket. [7]</li>
    <li>Many low-income or first-gen students “under-match” when selecting colleges. [8]</li>
    <li>Only 4% of underrepresented students enter college with the academic preparation for engineering. [9]</li>
    <li>Just 103 African-American and 112 Hispanic students earn engineering PhDs annually out of 7,000+. [6]</li>
    <li>Private college counseling can cost tens of thousands of dollars. [10]</li>
    <li>The average student-to-counselor ratio in U.S. public schools is 457:1. [11]</li>
  </ul>
